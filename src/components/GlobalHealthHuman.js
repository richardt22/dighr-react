    <h1>Global Health & Humanitarianism</h1>
    <h2>Today, over 140 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, while available assistance and protection fails to meet even half of the identified needs. With increasing climate and political instability globally, this unprecedented state of crisis is only expected to worsen.</h2>
    <p>The Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research is responding to this crisis by catalyzing collaborative research with operational partners from the humanitarian domain in two core areas:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Driving scientific research and technological innovation to improve the public health effectiveness of humanitarian response.</li>
        <li>Critically examining the history, governance, policy, and practices of humanitarianism with a view toward helping to create a global humanitarian system fit for the new century.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Current Projects</h3>
    <h4>Water Safety Optimization</h4>
    <p>Developing a machine learning-enabled water safety optimization tool that reduces the risk of waterborne infectious diseases in displacement camps.</p>

    <h4>Flood Modelling</h4>
    <p>Using drones to model flooding in displacement camps to inform camp planning and hazard mitigation/adaptation strategies.</p>
    
    <h4>Chemical Water Quality & Severe Acute Malnutrition</h4>
    <p>Investigating how chemical water quality influences the treatment and recovery of severely malnourished children and infants in therapeutic feeding centres during famine crises.</p>
